# Github Classroom Overview

You will receive an email with a link to a Github Classroom. It will look like https://classroom.github.com/a/XXXXXX. 
Follow the link provided in your email to add yourself to the classroom. 

Each assignment will be a new repository. In each case the assignment will be described in the repository's `README.md` 
file. The `README.md` will include ther grading rubric and an expectation of what needs to be turned in.

Please follow the Github Flow branching pattern described in: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/. When you first 
receive your assignment, create a new branch named after your github username or UA email address. The name of the branch is 
not actually important, though in practice it is important and a good practice to name branches descriptively and 
succinctly (e.g., `sidebar-refactor`). If you have questions in the assignment, you can commit your files to your branch and
start a conversation with me by tagging my username (`@aaryno` in this case) in a discussion. Discussion is line- and 
commit-specific, so the context of the discussion will be tied to the material. When you are satisfied the work is complete, 
create a `pull request` (or PR) to signal that you are ready to merge your branch with the master branch. The instructor 
will review your PR and approve (and grade) the assignment or deny if changes need to be made before it can be graded.
