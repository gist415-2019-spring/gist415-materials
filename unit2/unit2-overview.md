# Unit 2. Starting an Open Source GIS project 
## 1. Introduction
Unit 2 focuses on the life cycle ofopen source GIS projects comparedto proprietary software projects and on the 
community and roles behind open source development. Practical components in this unit aim to introduce the Open Source 
Geographic Information System QGIS and its library dependencies, as they will be used in programming activities over 
the course. Such practical tasks focus on the different ways that QGIS  programs  can  be implemented,  on opening 
QGIS  projects, and on  how  to connect  to  raster  and vector layers at the code level. 
## 2. Learning Objectives
- Be aware of the main features of QGIS and its toolkit structure.
- Describe the management and life cycle of an open sourceproject.
- Understand the human community and organization behind an open source project. 
- Install the appropriate Python and QGIS dependencies for the implementation of QGIS software. 
- Know the four basic ways to implement QGIS software with Python.
- Develop Python code to load QGIS projects.
- Develop Python code to access vector and raster geodatabases inmany common formats.

We recommend working onthe unit’s tasks in the above order. Please follow the instructions posted on D2L for the 
completion of these tasks.
## 4. Course software
This unit and the following ones will require the use of several software tools for GIS development, so you should make sure your work station has them up and running. Basically, you will need to have a Python interpreter and associated dependences set up,as well as QGIS and associated dependences set up. The recommended set up for this course is:•Python  2.6  or  2.7.  Python  is typically  installed  on  Microsoft,  Mac  and  Linux  machines,  though some attributes might be modified on your machine to make it operational on QGIS. The lab of this unit considers such dependencies.•IDLE.  IDLEis  a  Python  editor  thatcurrently  comes  with the Pythoninterpreteron  Windows machines. Feel free to use a different Python editor if you prefer.I tend torecommend a basic editor for simplicity in in interacting with the sourcecode...at the cost of losing advanced toolsinmore functional editors. Among the heaviesteditors,I recommend Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)   or   LiClipse   (https://www.liclipse.com/download.html), but thesearenot mandatory for this course assetting them up varies from one operating system to another.•QGIS 3.0. QGIS comes with PyQGIS (the Python-based QGIS API for desktop GIS)and PyQt4 (the Python-based QtAPI for cross-platform GUI development: https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download). Instructions todownload and installQGISare  available  at https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html.  Make  sure  you install the right version for your machine and do not hesitate to ask the course instructorabout it too.
