## Type of Activity 
Discussion
## Worth 
4 points
## Time effort 
2 hrs (est.)
## Topic 
GIS software design
## Aims
This discussion aims to encourage students to participate in a discussion about GIS software design. Based
on your course readings so far and on your knowledge gained over the course of the GIST program, you
are required to describe a GIS plugin prototype. To give you some reference about a GIS plugin to start
from, ArcGIS toolsets such as Hydrology were originally plugins that eventually got promoted as
supplementary packages of ArcGIS. Do not hesitate to study its structure and focus when preparing your
design and comments.
## Tasks
1. Summarize a GIS plugin design. Your summary should include:
- What the plugin aims to do.
- What users it is addressed to.
- What main modules and/or tools it would contain.
2. Using a graphics editor of your choice (e.g. CorelDraw, LibreOffice Draw, Gimp, PowerPoint,
Illustrator) draw a basic sketch of the different modules and functions of your GIS plugin. Share
your design with the class in the Discussion Board 1.
3. Comment on the design of at least one of your classmates’ contributions, pointing to the
relevance and challenges of her/his conclusions. Let’s be constructive in the comments and
feedback provided to each other.
