# UNITÂ 2 STARTING AN OPEN SOURCE GIS PROJECT
Unit 2 focuses on the life cycle of open source GIS projects compared to proprietary software 
projects and on the community and roles behind open source development. Practical components in 
this unit aim to introduce the Open Source Geographic Information System QGIS and its library 
dependencies, as they will be used in programming activities over the course. Such practical 
tasks focus on the different ways that QGIS programs can be implemented, on opening QGIS projects,
and on how to connect to raster and vector layers at the code level.
