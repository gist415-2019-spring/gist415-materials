# Unit 1. Fundamentals of Open Source software
## 1. Introduction
We land on GIST 415 with an overview on the technical, economic and social aspects of the Open Source software concept. 
Open Source GIS is merely the application of the Open Source software model to the development of 
Geographic Information Systems technology, so it inherits and reflects the Open Source paradigm, its contribution, 
and its critics. Unit 1 also aims to test your Python programming skills learned in GIST 315 or another programming 
course, as labs and other practical activities in this course will be based on Python coding.
## 2. Learning Objectives
- Understand the Open Source software model.
- Name differences between Open Source and other types of software distribution (e.g. the FreeSoftware paradigm).
- Gain a fundamental sense of the history of Open Source software.
- Familiarize with the Open Source GIS landscape.
- Assess oneself Python programming skills.
