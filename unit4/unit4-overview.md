# Unit 4. Business models, adoption and reuse in Open Source GIS

1. Introduction
Unit 4 centers on the business dimension of Open Source software projects. Increasingly, proprietary
software is including open source code as part of their software offer. Business and revenue reasons for
this, and social, economic and technical requirements are introduced in this unit. Linked to the success of
software solutions among the user community, adoption and reuse of open source are also described in
this unit, its benefits, modus operandi, and issues.

Practical Python programming gets back to the handling of raster and vector layers in QGIS, focusing on
the retrieval of layer properties, the rendering of layers, and on setting the style variables of rendered
datasets.

2. Learning Objectives
- Know the different commercial situations when proprietary software projects include open
source components.
- Summarize revenue modes that can be used to sustain open source software projects.
- Describe different business models in open source software projects.
- Tell the differences between adoption of open source and reuse of open source.
- Be aware of issues in the adoption and reuse of open source software.
- Be able to query raster and vector layer properties.
- Render raster and vector layers.
- Modify the visualization variables of rendered raster and vector layers.
