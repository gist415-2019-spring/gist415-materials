Licensing models in open source software

This discussion focuses on the usefulness and applicability of different software licenses that are
commonplace in Open Source software development.
For this discussion, you are required to:

1. View the following presentations:
   - “Licensing Models”, by E. Evans 2013 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o82QmitU4XE&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o82QmitU4XE&t=1s)
   - “Free software, free society”, by R. Stallman 2014 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&t=1s)

2. Contribute your thoughts on the usefulness and applicability of the software licensing models that
Open Source software projects typically comply with. Topics to think of and discuss about are:
- What licensing model(s), in your view, may be the most successful ones to promote users
penetration?
- How would different types of software licensing work in countries, industries or
communities with different revenue capacities?
- What technical, economic and social issues do you foresee in Free Software and/or Open
Source development?
- How could these issues be addressed while still complying with Open Source and/or Free
Software principles?
3. Comment on other students’ contributions at least once.

*Note:* As you will notice in the taped presentations, this is a sensitive topic and more often than not it has
boosted a heated debate with political and social implications. As always, let’s keep a respectful behavior
with others’ opinions and let’s work on building a constructive discussion. For more details about online
