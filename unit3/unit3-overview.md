# Unit 3. Open Source production and software licensing
## 1. Introduction
Unit 3 revolves around methods and systems for the implementation of Open Source Software and around
licensing of open source software products. User terms involve the legal expression of the Open Source
and Free Software paradigms and have become one of the primary factors that determine the success or
failure of commercial software projects. Consequently, choosing the right user license is not a trivial
decision in open source projects and has eventually become a “hot topic” among the free and open source
communities.

Practical open source programming will continue introducing Python methods for QGIS software
development, adding the topics of handling feature geometries and using projection systems to our
growing script already including project and layer handling tasks.

## 2. Learning Objectives
- Know modular development methods in Open Source projects.
- Be aware of the software release process.
- Define maintenance and quality control policies for open source software.
- Be aware of proprietary, copyleft and more permissive user licenses.
- Summarize the GPL licenses.
- Program QGIS behavior with different vector geometries (e.g. points, polylines , polygons).
- Handle projections systems in QGIS scripts.
